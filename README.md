Hi, I'm kinda lazy to explain so let's just keep everything simple and clear:
Open cmd in the exe directory, and then use it as follows: ``BadgeCounter.exe -u ROBLOX_USERNAME``. For example, if I want to count badges from badcc, it would be ``BadgeCounter.exe -u badcc``.
This project was made possible thanks to [roproxy](https://roproxy.com) which prevents you from being rate-limited by ROBLOX.

Also it kinda sucks and doesn't handle errors L
you need to have the .NET framework installed btw
